Welcome to the MEDIATION project's data catalog (standing for 'Methodological developments for a robust, efficient digital twin of the ocean'). Here you will find all the data produced and/or used within the project, that are already available. The main objective of this effort is to raise knowledge on the project's motivation and outcome, by providing information that complies with open science and F.A.I.R. data principles - therefore sharing reroductible results.
